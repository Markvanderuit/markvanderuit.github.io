Hi!

I am a fourth-year PhD student at the [Computer Graphics & Visualization Group](https://graphics.tudelft.nl) at the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/). My research interests include spectral rendering and the analysis of high-dimensional data. Together with my supervisor, [Elmar Eisemann](http://graphics.tudelft.nl/~eisemann/), I have worked on problems such as wavelength importance sampling, spectral uplifting, and linear-runtime t-SNE.

During my research, I am usually happiest when working on complex OpenGL/C++ projects, which occasionally leads to cool demos and renders. You can find examples throughout my portfolio and publications.

In my own time, I enjoy video games, reading fantasy/sci-fi, and running. I'm also a big fan of tabletop RPGs, so I run a few games as an occasionally grumpy game master.
